# Thread of Clues

**A collaborative mystery-solving game built for Reddit communities.**

## 🎯 Overview

**Thread of Clues** turns Reddit into a citywide investigation.   
There are multiple *locationn* (e.g. Vienna, London), where players discover clues by inspecting objects, sharing discoveries, and piecing together “fragment codes”.  
When all fragment clues are found, users can combine them to uncover each **location code**, which leads to the **main mystery solution**.

This game thrives on *community collaboration* - players must discuss, share hints, and work together to progress.
